# Monomer

An easy to use, Elm/Flutter inspired, GUI library for writing native applications in Haskell.

## Objectives

- It should be easy to use
- It should be possible to extend it with custom widgets
- It should work on Windows, Linux and macOS
- It should have good documentation
- It should have good examples

### Ideally, in the future, this project will

- Be able to run in mobile
- Support Vulkan/Metal

### Why would I want to use this library

- You want to write your application in Haskell
- You want to write a native, not Electron based, application
- You prefer not to use Gtk

### These are not objectives for this project

- Have a native look and feel
- Be a research project pushing the boundaries on how GUIs are created

### Current limitations

- Multi-platform features depend on what SDL already provides
  - Copy/paste is only supported for text, not images
- Text input capabilities are basic, supporting only left to right editing at the moment
